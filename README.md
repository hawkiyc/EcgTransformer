# EcgTransformer

This repository is implementation of "Transformer-based Neural Network for Electrocardiogram Classification" from "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, Vol. 13, No. 11, 2022". Please note that I am still working on the training processing and have not yet evaluation of model performance.
